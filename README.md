### Or, in English, "Hello, welcome to my Github Page".  
Hello, I go by Brandon. I'm a Taiwanese international student born in Canada, currently studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

### I'm currently working on,
As of now, a virtual assistant project that helps me monitor and maintain my mental status during work, manage and notify me of my daily operations, and caring for my emotional wellbeing through diverse means of sampling and analysis.  
I am really inspired by the aspect of affective computing where computers, machines, coexist with human in the same society via understanding the fundamental emotional motivations of human beings. It is my first, and perhaps immature approach at a computer-to-human interactive system.
If you'd like to check out the technical details and small design ideas I tried to incorporate in the project, check out the repository!

### Outside Classes,
Working as an academic student employee, my current position is reader at an introductory course for informational device and system design, teaching fundamental linear algebra and applying it to circuitry knowledge. I read, grade, help at office hours for this course. Meanwhile, as a senior mentor in my school's club "Computer Science Mentors", design weekly worksheets and educational content to aid students on exploring the field of EECS.
