Or, in English, "Hello, welcome to my Github Page". This used to be a popular opening sentence of personal blogs/websites when I was studying at elementary, middle school in Taiwan, but after I went to Illinois for 3.5 years of high school, I don't see this sentence as often as I did.
Hello, I go by Brandon. I'm a Taiwanese international student born in Canada, currently studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

#### I'm currently working on,
As of now, a virtual assistant project that helps me monitor and maintain my mental status during work, manage and notify me of my daily operations, and caring for my emotional wellbeing through diverse means of sampling and analysis. Hard to imagine putting words "care, emotion" and "sampling, analysis" together, on a computational entity, but I am really inspired by the aspect of affective computing where computers, machines, coexist with human in the same society via understanding the fundamental emotional motivations of human beings. It is my first, and perhaps immature approach at a computer-to-human interactive system.
If you'd like to check out the technical details and small design ideas I tried to incorporate in the project, check out the repository!

#### Outside Classes,
Besides double majoring at Berkeley, outside courses, I work as an Academic Student Employee as well as volunteer positions in my school's club "Computer Science Mentors".
Working as an academic student employee, my current position is reader at an introductory course for informational device and system design, teaching fundamental linear algebra and applying it to circuitry knowledge. I read, grade, help at office hours, and as a senior mentor in the aforementioned club, design weekly worksheets and educational content to aid students on exploring the field of EECS.

#### In this semester, I'm excited to learn about,
First and foremost, cognition. My first year schedule was concentrated on mathematics and computer science, and now, learning cognition, I can finally apply the relevant ideas and psychology onto my daily tasks, be it on my side project or when teaching. This is what my double major was for.
Other than that, I will finally learn about efficient means of manipulating and mining from data, the collaboration of mathematics and algorithm, and socio-cultural diffusions on an international scale. And last but not least, learning about teaching and desigining helpful things.
